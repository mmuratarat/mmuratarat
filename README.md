<h1 align="center">Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Murat</h1>

I am PhD-level educated, bilingual statistician and data scientist, who works to design, develop and implement advanced data-driven predictive methods, powered by machine learning and deep learning algorithms, to provide actionable insights from large volumes of real-world, structured and unstructured data in order to satisfy the business needs / goals for decision making across different industries and roles. I have a deep understanding of best data analytic practices to solve complex problems and I continuously improve myself and learn new emerging technologies, tools, and platforms to add new skills to my skill set.

My passion currently resides in modeling big data using supervised learning and unsupervised learning methods (such as machine learning and deep learning algorithms), Machine Learning Operations (MLOps), Transformer-based models on Hugging Face, Large Language Models (LLMs), Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and so on.

I am actively posting on LinkedIn both in English and Turkish! Let's connect and share the knowledge!
